```

### Knowledge Base Categories

- `kb/faq/`: Common questions and answers about background, skills, projects, and experience.
- `kb/faq/recruiters/`: Behavioral and recruiter-focused questions.
- `kb/projects/`: Project folders, each with its own `README.md` documenting technical details and implementations.
- `kb/resume/`: Resume and professional documents (PDF format).

Add a new project:
```bash
mkdir -p kb/projects/my-project
echo "# My Project" > kb/projects/my-project/README.md
```

### Customization Options

The knowledge base template can be changed based on your needs:

1. **Add new sections** - Create directories for specific content
2. **Remove sections** - Delete directories you don't need
3. **Modify existing content** - Edit files to match your information
4. **Add multimedia** - Include images, documents, presentations
5. **Create custom categories** - Add industry-specific or personal sections

### File Format Guidelines

- **Markdown files** (`.md`) - Preferred format for text content
- **PDF files** (`.pdf`) - For documents, resumes, certificates
- **Text files** (`.txt`) - For simple text content
- **Images** (`.png`, `.jpg`) - For visual content
- **JSON files** (`.json`) - For structured data


## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Python 3.12+** - Download from [python.org](https://python.org)
- **OpenAI API key** - Get one from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **UV package manager** (recommended) - Install with the command below
- **Git** - For cloning the repository

### Install UV Package Manager
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### 📥 Installation

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Alter-Ego.git
cd AI-Alter-Ego
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
# Using UV (recommended)
uv sync

# Or using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file and add your OpenAI API key
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

#### Step 4: Initialize Template Files
```bash
# Run the setup script to create template files
./setup_template.sh
```

This will create:
- Template FAQ files in `kb/faq/` (you can customize these based on your needs)
- Template personal profile in `me/`
- Knowledge base documentation

> **💡 Important**: The knowledge base template is flexible - you can modify, add, or remove any sections based on your specific needs.

### Customization

#### Step 5: Customize Your Knowledge Base

**Replace Template Content:**
1. **FAQ Files** - Edit files in `kb/faq/` directory:
   ```bash
   # Example: Edit career goals
   nano kb/faq/01-career-goals.md
   ```

2. **Personal Profile** - Update `me/summary.txt`:
   ```bash
   # Edit your personal summary
   nano me/summary.txt
   ```

3. **Project Documentation** - Add your projects to `kb/projects/`:
   ```bash
   # Create a new project folder
   mkdir kb/projects/my-awesome-project
   # Add project details
   echo "# My Awesome Project" > kb/projects/my-awesome-project/README.md
   ```

4. **Portfolio Materials** (Optional) - Add files to `kb/portfolio/` if needed:
   ```bash
   # Add images, documents, presentations
   mkdir -p kb/portfolio/images
   mkdir -p kb/portfolio/documents
   ```

5. **Resume Documents** - Add PDFs to `kb/resume/`:
   ```bash
   # Copy your resume and LinkedIn PDF
   cp /path/to/your/resume.pdf kb/resume/
   cp /path/to/your/linkedin.pdf kb/resume/
   ```

#### Step 6: Configure Personas (Optional)
```bash
# Edit persona configurations and prompts
nano persona_config.json

# Or edit the default personas in Python
nano app/core/personas.py
```

The persona system allows you to customize how the assistant responds:
- **Professional**: Formal, business-focused responses
- **Mentor**: Supportive, educational responses
- **Casual**: Friendly, conversational responses
- **Technical**: Deep technical focus with precise language

All questions are answered in first person as you (the author), based on the knowledge base content.

### Running the Application

#### Step 7: Start Your AI Assistant
```bash
uv run python main.py
```

### GUI Customization

All UI customizations live in `app/server/ui_gradio.py` (custom CSS inside the `gr.Blocks(css="""...""")` block).

#### Step 8: Access the Interface
- Open your browser to `http://localhost:7861`
- Start chatting with your AI alter ego!

### Testing Your Setup

Try asking these questions to test your setup:

- "What are your career goals?"
- "Tell me about your technical skills"
- "What projects have you worked on?"
- "What's your availability for work?"
- "Tell me about your education background"

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **OpenAI API Key Error**
   - Make sure your API key is correctly set in the `.env` file
   - Check that the key starts with `sk-`

2. **Port Already in Use**
   - Close any other applications using port 7860
   - Or restart your terminal

3. **Missing Dependencies**
   ```bash
   uv sync --force
   ```

4. **Knowledge Base Not Loading**
   - Make sure you ran `./setup_template.sh`
   - Check that files exist in `kb/faq/` and `me/` folders

### Next Steps

Once your basic setup is working:

1. **Add Your Content** - Replace template text with your actual information
2. **Test Questions** - Ask questions to make sure your AI responds correctly
3. **Deploy Online** - Use Hugging Face Spaces for public access
