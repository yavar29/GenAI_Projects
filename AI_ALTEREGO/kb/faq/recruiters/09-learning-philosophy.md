## Overview
I believe that learning is a **lifelong, iterative process** driven by curiosity, reflection, and experimentation.  
Whether through formal education, self-learning, or real-world problem-solving, I make it a habit to continuously evolve — both technically and personally.

---

## Core Learning Approach
- **Lifelong & Self-Directed** – I take ownership of my learning path, constantly exploring new frameworks, tools, and ideas relevant to AI and software engineering.  
- **Hands-On Learning** – I learn best by building — whether that’s developing a transformer model from scratch or deploying an ML pipeline end-to-end.  
- **Adaptive & Reflective** – I analyze what worked and what didn’t after every project or course, so each iteration makes me better.  
- **Collaborative Growth** – I believe learning is accelerated by teaching — mentoring peers, contributing to open-source, or discussing ideas in communities.

## Example: Learning During Resource Crunch at Accenture
While at **Accenture**, I led a **6-member team** during a high-stakes period with major resource shortages.  
Instead of panicking, I treated it as a **learning opportunity**:
- I **taught myself new API debugging and performance monitoring tools** over a weekend to fill a missing role.  
- I also **mentored two junior engineers** on API security and testing so they could independently manage releases.  
This experience reinforced my belief that learning is not about formal roles — it’s about **adaptability and willingness to grow** in real time.  
By staying proactive, our team delivered every milestone on time and reduced API errors from 25% to under 1%.

## Continuous Learning in Academia
During my **Master’s in Computer Science (AI/ML Track) at SUNY Buffalo**, I extended this mindset by:
- Taking challenging electives like **Pattern Recognition & Deep Learning**, **Computer Vision**, and **Operating Systems (Pintos)**.  
- Building projects that **forced me to learn beyond coursework**, such as implementing transformers, CNNs, and RAG pipelines from research papers.  
- Collaborating with diverse peers — learning how to explain complex models simply, which improved both my technical clarity and communication skills.

## How I Learn New Technologies
1. **Identify the Why** – Understand the purpose of a new tool or framework (e.g., *Why LangGraph for agentic systems?*).  
2. **Start Small** – Build a minimal working demo or proof of concept.  
3. **Iterate & Document** – Refine it, benchmark results, and note learnings.  
4. **Apply in Real Projects** – Integrate it into production-grade workflows.  
5. **Teach or Share** – Convert learnings into internal guides or public documentation.

This process helped me rapidly pick up **LangChain**, **Vertex AI**, and **multi-agent orchestration frameworks** for my recent weather assistant project.

---

## Learning Strategies & Habits
- **Project-Based Learning** – Every new concept becomes a mini-project; I rarely study without applying.  
- **Peer Mentorship** – I learn by explaining — simplifying tough topics for others helps deepen my own understanding.  
- **MOOCs & Online Platforms** – I actively use **Coursera**, **YouTube**, and **Medium papers** to explore new AI research.  
- **Reflection Journaling** – After major milestones, I document key lessons and decisions to refine my next project.

## Overcoming Learning Challenges
| Challenge | Strategy |
|------------|-----------|
| **Time Constraints** | Dedicate 1–2 focused learning hours daily, even during project peaks. |
| **Information Overload** | Curate selective resources instead of consuming everything. |
| **Application Gap** | Integrate theory into side projects immediately. |
| **Motivation Dips** | Track visible progress (commits, notes, or milestones) to stay accountable. |

---

## Mentorship & Knowledge Sharing
- **Mentoring Peers** – I’ve guided junior developers and classmates on ML model optimization and debugging workflows.  
- **Documentation & Tutorials** – I document learnings in concise internal guides or GitHub READMEs.  
- **Community Engagement** – Participate in open-source discussions and share snippets of learning experiences on platforms like LinkedIn or GitHub.  

I’ve found that teaching others cements understanding — it turns learning into contribution.

---

## Learning Philosophy
> “Learning is not an event — it’s a system.”  
For me, learning combines **curiosity (explore)**, **discipline (practice)**, and **reflection (refine)**.  
I believe the best learners are those who build, fail, and iterate faster — turning each experience into a stepping stone toward mastery.

---

## Summary
My learning philosophy revolves around **curiosity, adaptability, and contribution**.  
Whether leading a team during a resource crunch, mastering a new AI framework, or mentoring others, I approach every challenge as a structured opportunity to learn and grow — both as an engineer and as a person.
