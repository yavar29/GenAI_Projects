## Q: What is one challenge you encountered in your academic or professional life, and how did you deal with it?

### A:
One of the biggest challenges I faced professionally was during my time at **Accenture**, right in the middle of the **COVID-19 pandemic**.  
Our 6-member Agile API team was hit with a **major resource crunch** — two key engineers left suddenly, and we were in the middle of deploying multiple critical APIs for a pharmaceutical client.

I knew that stepping up was the only way forward, so I:
- **Redesigned our workflow** to focus on the most business-critical deliverables.  
- **Trained the remaining team members** by creating a **mini knowledge base** documenting every recurring task and deployment step.  
- Encouraged junior developers to **shadow me during deployments**, so they could learn hands-on.  
- **Delegated ownership** of client update calls, giving everyone visibility and confidence.  
- **Set up a routine of daily updates and quick syncs** to track progress and unblock issues faster.  

Despite the chaos of remote work and tight deadlines, we **delivered all our releases on schedule**, cut API error rates from **25% to below 1%**, and maintained high client satisfaction.  
For my leadership during that term, I was **recognized as the Best Employee of the Quarter**.  

That experience taught me that real leadership isn't about authority — it's about **empowering others**, maintaining structure during uncertainty, and ensuring the entire team grows through the challenge.

In my academic journey, I faced a similar challenge while working on my **Operating Systems (Pintos)** project at **SUNY Buffalo**. Debugging kernel-level race conditions was initially overwhelming, but by systematically isolating components, logging thread states, and iterating patiently, I passed all test cases successfully.  
Both experiences reinforced my belief that **consistency, structure, and mentorship** are key when dealing with complex problems.

## Q: How did you manage the team of six at Accenture?

### A:
At **Accenture**, I led a **6-member cross-functional team** responsible for developing and deploying APIs for a U.S.-based pharmaceutical client.  
The pandemic made things particularly challenging — we had a sudden resource shortage and a high-stakes delivery schedule.

To manage effectively, I:
- Introduced **daily 15-minute standups** and **weekly retrospectives** to stay aligned.  
- Built a **shared Confluence knowledge base** containing deployment steps, common issues, and SOPs for new joiners.  
- Encouraged team members to **shadow me during live deployments** and take turns leading **client update calls** to build confidence.  
- Ensured **everyone gave daily progress updates** — not to micromanage, but to promote ownership and visibility.  
- Balanced workloads fairly and **mentored junior engineers** on debugging, API monitoring, and performance tracking.  

The result:  
- We delivered every sprint on time during the pandemic.  
- Reduced production errors by over 90%.  
- Increased team autonomy and cross-skill coverage.  
- I was awarded **Best Employee of the Quarter** for leading the team through this phase with zero missed releases.  

This experience shaped my leadership philosophy — that **clarity, documentation, and empathy** are far more powerful than supervision.

## Q: Tell me about your projects other than what's mentioned in your resume.

### A:
When asked about projects beyond what's in my resume or LinkedIn profile, please refer to the documented projects in:
- `kb/projects/` - Each project has its own folder with a README.md containing detailed information
- `kb/faq/06-projects-highlight.md` - Choices for project highlights and summaries

Only list projects that have dedicated documentation in `kb/projects/*/README.md` with proper citations. Do not reference or fabricate projects that don't exist in these locations.

## Summary
These experiences taught me how to stay composed under uncertainty, lead with empathy, and build self-sustaining teams.  
Whether it was mentoring developers through remote delivery at Accenture or debugging a kernel at SUNY Buffalo, I've learned to approach every challenge as a chance to grow — and to help others grow with me.
