# 🤖 Context-Aware AI RAG Assistant - Your Personal AI Assistant

Built something I've been working on: **Context-Aware AI RAG Assistant**, a context-aware assistant that understands your background, projects, and interests—and even sends notifications when someone asks something new.

## 🎯 What It Does

**Retrieval-Augmented Memory** 🧠 — Reads markdown notes, summaries, and PDFs with character-based chunking

**Function Calling Tools** 🧩 — Records new user details or unknown questions automatically

**Real-Time Notifications** 📲 — Pushover alerts for new interactions and connection requests

**Persona Switching** 🎭 — Changes tone between Professional, Mentor, Casual, or Technical modes

**FAISS Vector Store** 💾 — Persistent on-disk storage for fast semantic search

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.12+ | OpenAI API | FAISS | Gradio | Pushover. No complex frameworks required—just clean, extensible code that anyone can understand and customize.

## 💡 Why I Built It

It's not just a chatbot; it's a context replica. Feed it your work, your tone, your story, and it starts answering the way you would.

That's the shift in agentic design: we're moving beyond prompt engineering into **context orchestration**. The system learns to represent you by organizing your knowledge, not just responding from a template.

## 🔧 Designed as a Template

The architecture is modular and extensible. Perfect for interview preparation, professional networking, knowledge management, or personal branding. Each component works independently, making it easy to extend with new features.

## 🚀 What's Next

Planned extensions include:
- **Evaluator Agent** — Scores responses for accuracy, tone, and completeness
- **Voice Interface** — Speech-to-text and text-to-speech integration
- **Context Connectors** — Live updates from GitHub, LinkedIn, or Google Calendar
- **Analytics Dashboard** — Track unanswered queries and response quality

Since everything is modular, you can add features incrementally without rewriting core components.

What would you add next? Always open to ideas—maybe a knowledge-sync agent, voice memory layer, or API gateway?
