Just wrapped up something I've been building quietly for a while — a Context-Aware AI Assistant that represents your professional persona and answers questions about your background, projects, and skills in a natural, consistent way.

The idea was to move beyond generic chatbots and create something personal, context-aware, and easy to extend. I wanted a system that anyone could build on — using minimal dependencies and avoiding heavy orchestration frameworks like full LangChain chains or CrewAI. The architecture is modular and focused on clean, extensible code.

Here's what makes it work:

Custom RAG pipeline using OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-small) and FAISS for semantic retrieval with persistent on-disk vector storage

Dynamic knowledge base that reads Markdown, TXT, and PDF files with character-based chunking using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for optimal boundary handling

Persona switching between Professional, Mentor, Technical, and Casual modes — implemented with JSON-based configuration and dynamic prompt templating

Contextual reasoning via GPT-4 function calling for precise, first-person answers grounded in your knowledge base with strict anti-hallucination policies

Private KB integration with Hugging Face Datasets for secure knowledge storage — the Space stays public while personal data stays private

Clean Gradio UI deployed publicly on Hugging Face Spaces with Python 3.12+ and minimal dependencies (gradio, openai, faiss-cpu, langchain-text-splitters, langchain-community)

Technical stack: Python 3.12+ • OpenAI API (GPT-4) • FAISS vector store • LangChain utilities (text splitters, document loaders) • Gradio 5.33 • Modular architecture

Every part of it — from RAG setup to deployment — is explained in a detailed README, making it easy for anyone to adapt and build their own personal assistant.

If you've been exploring RAG systems, contextual reasoning, or model orchestration, this could be a good place to start experimenting.

Would love to hear your thoughts — what features would you add next?
