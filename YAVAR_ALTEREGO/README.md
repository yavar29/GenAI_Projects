## 🌐 Hugging Face Spaces Deployment

This project is designed for seamless deployment on Hugging Face Spaces with Gradio:

### Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces

1. **Create a new Space**
   - Go to [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/new-space)
   - Choose "Gradio" as the SDK
   - Set visibility (public/private)

2. **Configure the Space**
   ```yaml
   # README.md in your Space
   ---
   title: Yavar's AI Alter Ego
   emoji: 🤖
   colorFrom: blue
   colorTo: purple
   sdk: gradio
   sdk_version: 5.22.0
   app_file: main.py
   pinned: false
   ---
   ```

3. **Add secrets**
   - Add your OpenAI API key as a Space secret
   - Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the Space settings

4. **Deploy**
   - Push your code to the Space repository
   - The Space will automatically build and deploy

### One-Click Deploy
