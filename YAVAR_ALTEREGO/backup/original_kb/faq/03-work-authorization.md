## Work authorization status

I am eligible to work in the U.S. under **OPT (Optional Practical Training)** upon graduation, which is fully authorized by my university and requires no employer sponsorship.

## Do you require visa sponsorship to work in the United States?

No, I do **not** require employer-based visa sponsorship to begin working in the U.S.  
After graduating in **December 2025**, I will be eligible to work full-time under **OPT (Optional Practical Training)**, which is authorized and managed by my university — not the employer.

## What about long-term sponsorship needs?

My OPT can later be extended through the **STEM OPT extension**, allowing me to work for up to **three years** without requiring employer sponsorship.  
During that time, if an employer wishes to continue my employment beyond STEM OPT, we can explore sponsorship options together — but it’s **not required initially**.

## Countries where you can work

United States of America

## Documentation available

I have all necessary documentation ready and can provide:
- Valid identification documents
- Work authorization documentation
- Educational credentials
- Professional references
- Background check information

## Timeline for authorization

I will graduate in **December 2025** from the University at Buffalo (SUNY). 
I plan to file my **OPT application immediately upon receiving my offer**, so I can start full-time work in **January 2026**.  
Once approved, I will be authorized to work in the U.S. for **12 months under OPT**, followed by an additional **24-month STEM OPT extension** — giving a total of **three years** of work eligibility.

## Remote work authorization

I am authorized to work remotely and can provide any necessary documentation for remote work arrangements.

## International work experience

While I haven’t worked for an organization outside India or the U.S., I have collaborated on **numerous global and cross-border projects** during my time at **Accenture** and throughout my **Master’s at the University at Buffalo**.

## Could you describe some international projects you’ve worked on?
 At Accenture, I worked with teams spread across the **U.S., Prague, and Singapore**, supporting a major U.S.-based pharmaceutical client.  
In my graduate studies, I’ve also collaborated with **multinational student teams** on AI/ML projects like:
- A **multi-agent weather assistant** using Vertex AI and Open-Meteo APIs.  
- A **transformer-based sentiment analysis model** trained on large-scale global review data (Yelp Polarity dataset).  
These projects gave me deep exposure to international collaboration, technical documentation standards, and cross-timezone communication — even without formal overseas employment.
