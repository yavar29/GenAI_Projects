## Short-Term Goals (1 – 2 Years)
- **Technical Depth**
  - Strengthen expertise in **transformers, large-scale RAG systems**, and **multi-agent workflows**.  
  - Advance my understanding of **MLOps** and scalable deployment pipelines.  
  - Contribute to open-source projects and research on model reliability and interpretability.

- **Professional Growth**
  - Lead full ML projects end-to-end —from design to production.  
  - Present my work at AI/ML conferences or campus events.  
  - Mentor peers and new students on applied ML and GenAI projects.

- **Skill Expansion**
  - Sharpen cross-functional collaboration and communication.  
  - Gain stronger business understanding of AI product lifecycles.
